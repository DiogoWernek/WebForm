<h1>ðŸš€ WebForm - Children's School Enrollment</h1>

I had the opportunity to develop a School Enrollment Form for a children's school as part of a practical exercise from Rocketseat. ðŸ’»

This challenging project involved creating a functional and responsive WebForm where parents can register their children. The form collects important information such as the childâ€™s name, date of birth, parents' names, address, and other necessary data for enrollment.

It was a great experience that allowed me to practice essential HTML and CSS concepts. This exercise was a fantastic way to enhance my front-end development skills while exploring forms and responsiveness. ðŸŽ¨âœ¨

I am thankful to Rocketseat for the opportunity to put this learning into practice and share this project with the community. ðŸš€
